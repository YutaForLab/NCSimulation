My works of simulation of combination neck-cooler with air-conditioner.

After 1st skype meeting on December 21st, I tried to use "Frodo" which
is GUI application and can simulate DCOP solving.
Before using it, I had to install "Graphviz" which need to describe
graphs with Frodo.
I found it and install, so I succeeded in carry out Frodo application.
At first, I solved sample problem. Next I will study making problem files.
